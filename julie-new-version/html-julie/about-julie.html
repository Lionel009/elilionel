            Born in France, I have lived and worked in five cities: Paris,
            London, Madrid, New York and Tel Aviv. After 10 years as an
            Institutional Sales in Investment Banking, I decided to focus on
            personal and team development. Over the last 15 years, I explored
            coaching, training, facilitating and systemic intelligence in order
            to gather the most impactful behavioral techniques that are directly
            applicable to business performance.

            After working for years in executive positions in large global
            companies, Julie set herself on a mission: reconnect business
            objectives with talents’ aspirations. WORK = MONEY + PERSONAL
            FULFILLMENT. In her experiential talks, she shares her insights
            based on her unique combination of international business experience
            and deep knowledge of people and organizational development. She
            created an online program called "Vertical TakeOff" to help
            organisations to develop their collective intelligence, and
            implement new ways of working, more adapted to today's environment.
            Julie holds a Master in Management from ESCP Europe. She is an
            ICF-PCC Certified Executive and Team coach and ORSC-CC (Certified
            Organisational Relationship Systems Coach)
