  <div class="underline"></div>
  <p class="team-center ">Have you ever felt your team is sometimes stuck in meetings:</p>
     <p>Are they a theater of ego fights? Does anyone dare to speak up and address the real issue? 
    At the level of the organisation, the impact is heavier than the time wasted: many postponed or mistaken decisions, many projects stuck because of misaligned stakeholders, a contagious frustration that there is so much more we could achieve together.</p>
  <p class="team-center">Spice up your next event with the inspiring experiential talk, where your people will learn and practice:
   </p>
  <p>- How to address disagreement in a constructive way</p>
  <p>- Good meeting behaviors that foster efficient discussions</p>
  <p>- What to do when the group dynamic interferes with the actual business topic</p>
  <p class="team-center">You’ll leave with practical tools to hack your meetings. Witness their impact on your team performance.</p>
