          Have you ever felt your team is sometimes stuck in meetings?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Are they a theater of ego fights? Does anyone dare to speak up and
          address the real issue? At the level of the organisation, the impact
          is heavier than the time wasted: many postponed or mistaken decisions,
          many projects stuck because of misaligned stakeholders, a contagious
          frustration that there is so much more we could achieve together.
        </p>
        <h4 class="team-center">
          Spice up your next event with the inspiring experiential talk, where
          your people will learn and practice:
        </h4>
        <p>- How to address disagreement in a constructive way.</p>
        <p>- Good meeting behaviors that foster efficient discussions.</p>
        <p>
          - What to do when the group dynamic interferes with the actual
          business topic.

          You’ll leave with practical tools to hack your meetings. Witness their

            <p class="julie-history-p">
              Born in France, I have lived and worked in five cities: Paris,
              London, Madrid, New York and Tel Aviv. After 10 years as an
              Institutional Sales in Investment Banking, I decided to focus on
              personal and team development.
            </p>
            <p class="julie-history-p">
              Over the last 15 years, I explored coaching, training,
              facilitating and systemic intelligence in order to gather the most
              impactful behavioral techniques that are directly applicable to
              business performance.
            </p>
            <p class="julie-history-p">
              Today, I accelerate the success of ambitious executives and their
              teams, by teaching them collective intelligence skills.
            </p>
            <p>After working for years in executive positions in large global companies, Julie set herself on a mission: reconnect business objectives with talents’ aspirations.

              WORK = MONEY + PERSONAL FULFILLMENT.
In her experiential talks, she shares her insights based on her unique combination of international business experience and deep knowledge of people and organizational development.

She created an online program called "Vertical TakeOff" to help organisations to develop their collective intelligence, and implement new ways of working, more adapted to today's environment.

Julie holds a Master in Management from ESCP Europe. She is an ICF-PCC Certified Executive and Team coach and ORSC-CC (Certified Organisational Relationship Systems Coach)</p>
